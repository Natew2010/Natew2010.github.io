        <p>Bunnies are <em>so</em> cute and fluffy! They are one of the <strong>best</strong> pets in the world. They love snuggling! If you want to get one as a pet, here are some things to know: first, they do NOT eat carrots, like myth has it. They are a sugary treat for them! Do not feed them to much. Instead, rabbits LOVE greens like lettuce.</p>

        <p>Cats are so soft, and they <strong>love</strong> playing with you! You can give them balls, Pom-Poms, or little mice toys. They eat wet and dry cat food. Make sure you dont accadentally eat some! Ew!!! They also like chicken.</p>

        <p>Hermit crabs <em>aren't</em> much fun. But they're interesting to watch. They go underground for months at a time, and burrow down there. When they do come up, they mostly just drink water. Also, sometimes, when they outgrow their shell, they pick a new one that fits, if theres one lying around.</p>
